# CS 3035 - Class Project - Fall 3035

## Note for the markers :)
There are some changes made to this project after the deadline. Please note that these are solely for my personal pleasure :) The project video below shows only what I was able to complete within the deadline.

### Implementation Requirements

- You will use/adapt the sketching methods discussed in class to your project (see slides from our sketching lecture; you can use a 5+5 method)
- Your application must use an MVC design
- Your application should provide at least two different views for some aspect of your model
- Your application should have a splash screen, a menu bar (with appropriate content), a Help menu
 - The Help Menu should include a Help Screen, and an About that Displays your team's "company logo" and team members
- Your application must provide a consistent and appropriate look and feel (i.e., colors, fonts, etc.) for your project
- Your application should contain at least one custom designed widget that appropriately allows you to enter and display information about some aspect of your domain objects
- Your application should allow interacting and entering model information for at least 3 different types of domain objects (e.g., a calendar app might allow you to create/edit/delete users, meetings, and holidays)
- Domain objects should be able to be created, edited/updated/changed and deleted as appropriate through user or system actions
- Provide a set of exemplary domain objects that are pre-populated in your application
 - Your application does not need to save its updated state when it is closed (i.e., the system will return to its original state upon restarting)
- Be creative - some points will be reserved for the complexity/creativity of the projects, but do not go too far


### Project Deliverables

- a AUTHORS.md file including the name of all group members and important details on your submission
- a working jar file of a javafx program with source files
- images/photos of all sketches that were used to plan the applications design, use sticky notes to describe how you used these to guide your final design, copy these into the sketches folder in your submission... edit the SKETCHES.md file to describe the images.
- a short one-page report describing your project, available in REPORT.md
- a video demonstration of your app (no longer than 3.5 mins long, if it's shorter that's fine). The video can be narrated, but should demonstrate all the main functionality of your app. Upload your videos to Streams and share the link in your report. https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/347f1a2e-3ca0-4994-9b27-60b730c3afc5
